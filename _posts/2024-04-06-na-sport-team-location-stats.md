# Question

Today I saught to answer the question, "Which sports league has the most solo team locations (Only professional team in town)?". Instead of trying to Duck this, I chose to use Google Sheets to answer this for me.
In order to avoid inconsistent location naming between teams in the same location (ie: New England Patriots and Boston Red Socks both play in Boston), the team locations were 'normailized' enought to be useful. 

My data sheet used to generate the answer

# Answer(s) (as of time of writting)
The NHL has the most solo team cities with 10 (Calgary, Columbus, Edmonton, Montreal, Newark, Ottawa, Raleigh, San Jose, Vancouver, Winnipeg). It should be noted that 6 of them are in Canada.

### If we exclude Canadian cities (for being located in a silly place)
The NBA has the most solo team American cities with 7 (Memphis, Olkahoma City, Orlando, Portland, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio)

# future work (?)
- what if the MLS is included?
- NCAA ? (how would that be normalized?)
- market size w.r.t. number of teams present
