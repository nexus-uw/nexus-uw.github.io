So I built a simple compound interest rate calculator using [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) this afternoon. Gotta say it is pretty nice after working with Angular 2 for the past 8 months.
Vue.js brings me back to the good old days of Angular 1 with the ability to build an app in 60 LOC (all in index.html) without having to use webpack or some CLI.

Stay tuned for part 2, where I will reflect on polishing the app up to be more professional with components and unit tests.
