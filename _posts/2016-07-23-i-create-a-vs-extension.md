I just created a VSCode extension, _vscode-gtm_, that integrates Git Time Tracking (aka gtm) with VSCode.

Feel free to try it out ([vs market place link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=s3ramsay.vscode-gtm))

(from [git-time-metric/gtm](https://github.com/git-time-metric/gtm))

>Git Time Metrics (GTM) is a tool to automatically track time spent reading and working on code that you store in a Git repository. By installing GTM and using supported plug-ins for your favorite editors, you can immediately realize better insight into how you are spending your time and on what files.

>GTM is automatic, seamless and lightweight. There is no need to remember to start and stop timers. It's a process that only runs on occasion to capture edit events triggered by the editor. It does not require a background process or any file system monitoring.

>Your time metrics are stored locally with the repository as Git notes. If you want to share your data, it can be pushed and fetched to and from the remote repository. Other GTM users on your team can do the same. This provides you the ability to see time metrics for the entire team.
