ramsay.xyz is now available on [InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)](https://ipfs.io). 

It can be easily accessed through its IPNS over at Cloudflare's gateway [cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/fleek.ramsay.xyz](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipns/fleek.ramsay.xyz)


## how
1. changed the jekyll build to [generate relative links instead of absolute links](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web3/ipfs-gateway/reference/updating-for-ipfs/#jekyll)
2. deployed site using [fleek.co](https://fleek.co) (including setting up a dns link)
