1. 401ks are similar to RSPs but the money has to be taken off your paycheck by your employer (you can not go down to your bank and open your own account).
2. Traditional IRAs are similar to TFSAs but there is a max income threshold after which you are not (normally) allowed to contribute.
3. It is best to get your Canadian accounts in order before moving, because after you update your address your Canadian bank will treat you very differently (ie: cant open new credit cards, cant purchase anything more complicated that a basic GIC, cant contribute or rebalance RSPs)
4. closing out your TFSA before you move will avoid taxation concerns from IRS
5. reducing the number of Canadian bank accounts will make filling out your annual FBAR form a lot easier. being able to go a physical branch makes this process easier.
6. updating your online accounts to be American based risks them being locked due to suspicious activity, so consider creating new (parrallel) accounts.

note: none of the above is legal or finanical advice. Im not a professional in either. Talk to someone better (but use the above as starting point)

note: this might all be outdated at this point
