As a *fun* task, I relearned first year pure functional programming using [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).  To generate something more useful and exciting than YATA (**Y**et **A**nother **T**odo **A**pp), I decided to come up with a simple calculator for figuring out much it will cost per day to operate a Redis Cluster on AWS Elastic Cache for a given size + network speed.

Take Aways
- Its amazing how much one can forget from 1st year CS
- Even coming from writing functional-ish all day at work, pure functional programming is hard (really wished for an optional index param when iterating through a list)
- Elm's documentation code really be fleshed out to cover more than how to get things started and how the language compares to JS
- Elm's compilation errors were really clear and useful (especially in VS Code)
