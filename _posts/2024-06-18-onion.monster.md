[CODE](https://github.com/nexus-uw/cosburn-is-lost)


what
a tor2web style proxy to expose hidden services as activity pub servers. 
 this allows them to federate with *all* other servers without them having to set up their own tor proxy + routing AND it allows for https requests to be made to the hidden service 


how
use socks proxy + tor container to connect to hidden service

by exposing on https, we receive federation requests (from my cursoerly glance, a lot of activity pub has hard coded in https)

why
this lets people spin up their own activty pub server without having to disclose their server location
additionally, they can exclusily own their data + moderation

it was also something fun + limited to implement in my spare time


security problems
https is terminated at proxy level, and an http request is made to the hidden service. while the http connection is safe to move through the tor network (due to onion routing), it is exposed to the proxy.
the proxy could inspect the contents of the request (severity of this depends if the message is intended to be private or public and how the server is intended to be operated)

as a publisher, connecting to the server through onion.monster is riskier since there is no mechanism to guartener that the request has not been modified by the server
also, user passwords are exposed to the proxy

xss cookie attacks *(since running under same root domain)


things that work fine otherwise
incoming federation requests - http signature ensures that they have not been tamper with by the proxy
outgoing federation requests - they do not go back out through the proxy (but ideally their own tor)


TODO - confirm publishers should ideally connect to their server either locally OR directly through their onion domain


federation problems
randos are operating under the same root domain, if someone finds a problem with a single server, they may just black list the entire root domain. if this blacklisting grows to be included in the shared blacklists, then all servers (including future ones) will never been seen by a good chunk of the "fedi verse"

this is why running a server using one of the existing tor2web services, would not be a good idea (since they are mostly unmoderated). onion.monster operates on a whitelist model, where only known servers are allowed to be served through it. ideally, if someone starts to cause trouble, only they will be removed
-> this does still have the 'someone else' can kick me off a fedi server if they dont like me BUT said bad actor would still pocess  their data, and they could move their server elsewhere 

next steps
would be really cool if the proxy did not have to know about the contents of the request. 2 ways of achiving this 
1. https onion domains, as of 2024 they are expensive, rare , and difficult to get. MAYBE this change in the future
2. e2e encryption on the publisher messages to the server BUT that requires a custom client + server. this does not exist today AND it would require a custom implementation. since i see this as a very small niche (and kinda against the intent of activity pub with servers + server administration being very important) I dont see anyone implementing  this
this does start sounding more like nostr
