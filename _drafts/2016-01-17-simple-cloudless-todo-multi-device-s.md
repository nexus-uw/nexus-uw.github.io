## Need
  - a selfhosted open source todo list app that works on OSX, Linux, and Android


## One (Possible) Solution
### [todo.txt]() + [BitTorrent Sync]()
  - setup

## Alternative Solution
### Code a web yourself (the sample app for just about every UI framework is a todo app)
- __BUT__ that takes time to create and maintain

## Partial solution
### Google Keep
- has a native Android app as well as a offline Google Chrome app
